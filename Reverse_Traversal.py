# Linked List Reverse Traversal:

# Forward pointer initialized to (head.next) in the current list and reverse pointer to head in the already reversed linked list
# Set reverse pointer.next == None, this becomes the last node in the linked list
# forward_pointer iterates until it reaches None. The current node becomes the head of reversed linked list.
# Iteration stops when forward pointer == None and reverse pointer is pointing to new head
